## Dagger - a light, robust Web UI autotest framework

Dagger is a light, robust Web UI autotest framework based on [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) and [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html).（中文介绍参见[这里](https://github.com/NetEase/Dagger/wiki/Dagger)）

> Dagger is an automation framework first, it provides APIs to control browsers;
> 
> Dagger is a test framework then, it uses TestNG to organize testcases and TestNG's assertions are embedded in APIs above;
> 
> Dagger is a design style at last: the framework and the testcases based on it both should be light and straightforward.

## Features

* Easy to learn while only less than 30 APIs altogether, see [this](http://netease.github.com/Dagger/classcom_1_1netease_1_1dagger_1_1_browser_emulator.html).
* High speed with parallel mode which is indeed TestNG's feature, see [this](https://github.com/NetEase/Dagger/wiki/Parallel-Mode)
* Re-run failed test cases using [Arrow](https://github.com/NetEase/arrow), see [this](https://github.com/NetEase/Dagger/wiki/Retry-Failed-Testcases-using-Arrow).
* Use Chrome as default browser which is much quicker and more stable than all Firefox, IE and Safari. 
* Firefox, IE and Safari are also supported.
* Capture screenshot automatically when testcase fails.
* Support data-driven testing.
* Contrast images and compare differences by crawling page elements and screenshots on the pixel level.
* Support Flash automation testing.


## How to Use

Dagger is quite suitable for a small group to kick off Web UI autotest. For this case, just checkout Dagger and configure maven with Eclipse and then write testcases with it.

Already have an autotest framework? Please build Dagger into a .jar file before use, the steps are as follows: 
*  Checkout Dagger's source code
*  Enter the root directory
*  Run `mvn clean package -DskipTests` in terminal

Then fetch `dagger-1.3.jar` under `target` folder, or just [download](https://github.com/NetEase/Dagger/releases/download/v1.3/dagger-1.3.jar) the `dagger-1.3.jar`. See [this](https://github.com/NetEase/Dagger/wiki/FAQ) for more details.

Currently, we use `selenium-server-standalone-2.39.0.jar` and `selenium-safari-driver-2.39.0.jar` , you can change the configuration in the _pom.xml_.

By the way, you should download the [chromedriver_for_win_2.3.exe](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.3/chromedriver_win32.zip) and [iedriver_win32_2.39.0.exe](http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/IEDriverServer_Win32_2.39.0.zip) if necessary. We suggest to put the .exe files in the `res` folder.
